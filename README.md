# Free Code Camp Full Data Science Course

### Module 0 - Introduction

#####  What is Data Science
A field that uses scientific methods to extract knowledge and insight from data, the field also has the following specializations:
- Data Engineers: Build software that gathers data from different sources
- Machine Learning scientist/engineer: Develop algorithms. 
- Data Analysts: Answers business questions based on the insight drawn from the data collected.

#####  Data Science Environment setup - basic
- Install & setup Anaconda
    > Anaconda comes with Jupyter - a note made for Data scientist to experiment on 


### Module 1 - Regression
simple linear regression formula: y = $\alpha$ + $\beta x$
multiple linear regression y = $\alpha$ + $\beta x1$ + $\beta x2$ + $\beta x3$ + ... + $\beta xn$

### Module 2 - Classification
simple classification: Binary classification
classify in more than 2(1:0/True:False) classes
    > example:
        - spam or not
        - fraudulent transaction or not
        - eye colour (blue, green, brown)

Regression VS Classification
 - Regression: response variable is quantitative 
 - Classification: response variable is categorical or qualitative
